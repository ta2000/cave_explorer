# Cave Explorer
This was my first game project, it is currently not in a working state.  
I made it a while ago and now I can't figure out how to build it.  
  
The game used FreeGLUT with OpenGL, and has no textures or audio.  
At its last update the game had preocedurally created levels which generated a large filled space,  
placed rooms in it randomly, then connected the rooms. There were also enemies with basic AI, and a boss  
every 10 levels(?). There's a couple cool things in it, but overall it is a poorly constructed project.
